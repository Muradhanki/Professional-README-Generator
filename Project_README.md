## About The Project


https://github.com/Muradhanki/Professional-README-Generator

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, my task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer packageLinks to an external site.. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js

The app contains the following requirements:


* When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
    * The title of my project 
    * Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Questions
    * When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
    * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    * When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
    * When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
    * When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
    * When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
